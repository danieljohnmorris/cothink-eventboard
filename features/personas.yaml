Joe:
    Joe is researching home improvement industry events when he comes across the site. He is very suspicious of signing up for things, after that incident with the friendly Nigerian colonel. Sites really have to look honest and prove their utility for Joe to risk his account details and take the time to remember them. He has only a tangeindental interest in going to more events, as his kitchen refitting business is workingly nicely.
