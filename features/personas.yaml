Joe:
    Joe is researching home improvement industry events when he comes across the site. He is very suspicious of signing up for things, after that incident with the friendly Nigerian colonel. Sites have to look honest and clearly prove their utility for Joe to risk his account details and take the time to find them in his special book. He has only a tangeindental interest in going to more events, as his kitchen refitting business is workingly nicely.
